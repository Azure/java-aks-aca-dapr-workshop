# Deploying Applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Dapr

In this assignment, you will deploy the 3 services and the simulation to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). First there is a [introduction to Dapr sidecar in Kubernetes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link modules/05-assignment-5-aks-aca/01-aks/1-dapr-sidecar-in-k8s.md %}). Then you will [deploy the 3 services and the simulation to AKS]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link modules/05-assignment-5-aks-aca/01-aks/2-aks-instructions.md %}). Finally you will test the application.

There are two more optional exercises in this assignment. The first one is to [setup observability in AKS using OpenTelemetry]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link modules/05-assignment-5-aks-aca/01-aks/3-observability-with-open-telemetry.md %}). The second one is to use [GitOps to deploy the application to AKS]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link modules/05-assignment-5-aks-aca/01-aks/4-gitops.md %}).
