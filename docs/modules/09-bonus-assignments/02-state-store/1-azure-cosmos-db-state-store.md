This bonus assignment is about using [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/) as a [state store](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/components/setup-state-store/) for the `TrafficControlService` instead of keeping the sate in memory. You will use the [Azure Cosmos DB state store component](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/setup-azure-cosmosdb/) provided by Dapr.

## Step 1: Create an Azure Cosmos DB

{% include 09-bonus-assignments/02-state-store/1-1-create-cosmos-db.md %}

## Step 2: Configure the Azure Cosmos DB state store component

1. Open the file `dapr/azure-cosmosdb-statestore.yaml` in your code editor and look at the content of the file.

1. **Copy or Move** this file `dapr/azure-cosmosdb-statestore.yaml` to `dapr/components` folder.
   
1. **Replace** the following placeholders in the file `dapr/components/azure-cosmosdb-statestore.yaml` with the values you noted down in the previous step:

    - `<YOUR_COSMOSDB_ACCOUNT_URL>` with the Cosmos DB account URL
    - `<YOUR_COSMOSDB_MASTER_KEY>` with the master key

## Step 3: Add the Azure Cosmos DB state store to the `TrafficControlService`

{% include 09-bonus-assignments/02-state-store/1-3-update-traffic-control-service.md %}

Now you can test the application

## Step 4: Test the application

You're going to start all the services now. 

1. Make sure no services from previous tests are running (close the command-shell windows).

1. Open the terminal window and make sure the current folder is `VehicleRegistrationService`.

1. Enter the following command to run the VehicleRegistrationService:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

1. Open a **new** terminal window and change the current folder to `FineCollectionService`.

1. Enter the following command to run the FineCollectionService with a Dapr sidecar:

   ```bash
   dapr run --app-id finecollectionservice --app-port 6001 --dapr-http-port 3601 --dapr-grpc-port 60001 --resources-path ../dapr/components mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

1. Open a **new** terminal window and change the current folder to `TrafficControlService`.

1. Enter the following command to run the TrafficControlService with a Dapr sidecar:

   ```bash
   dapr run --app-id trafficcontrolservice --app-port 6000 --dapr-http-port 3600 --dapr-grpc-port 60000 --resources-path ../dapr/components mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

1. Open a **new** terminal window and change the current folder to `Simulation`.

1. Start the simulation:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

You should see the same logs as before. Obviously, the behavior of the application is exactly the same as before.
