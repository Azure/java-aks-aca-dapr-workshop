In this assignment, you will use Dapr to invoke the `VehicleRegistrationService` from the `FineCollectionService`. You will use the [service invocation building block](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/service-invocation-overview/) provided by Dapr.

<!-- ------------ STEP 1 - INVOKE VEHICLE REGISTRATION SERVICE ------------- -->

{% assign stepNumber = 1 %}
{% include 09-bonus-assignments/01-service-invocation/1-use-dapr-to-invoke-vehicle-registration-service.md %}

Now you can test the application.

{% assign stepNumber = stepNumber | plus: 1 %}
## Step {{stepNumber}}: Test the application

You're going to start all the services now. 

1. Make sure no services from previous tests are running (close the command-shell windows).

1. Open the terminal window and make sure the current folder is `VehicleRegistrationService`.

1. Enter the following command to run the VehicleRegistrationService with a Dapr sidecar:

   ```bash
   dapr run --app-id vehicleregistrationservice --app-port 6002 --dapr-http-port 3602 --dapr-grpc-port 60002 --resources-path ../dapr/components mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   `FineCollectionService` Dapr sidecar uses Vehicle Registration Service `app-id` to resolve the service invocation endpoint. The name (i.e. `app-id`) of `VehicleRegistrationService` is set in the application properties of `FineCollectionService` (i.e. `application.yaml`) as shown below:

   ```yaml
   vehicle-registration-service.name: ${VEHICLE_REGISTRATION_SERVICE:vehicleregistrationservice}
   ```

   The default value is `vehicleregistrationservice` that can be override using the environment variable `VEHICLE_REGISTRATION_SERVICE`.

1. Open a **new** terminal window and change the current folder to `FineCollectionService`.

1. Enter the following command to run the FineCollectionService with a Dapr sidecar:

   ```bash
   dapr run --app-id finecollectionservice --app-port 6001 --dapr-http-port 3601 --dapr-grpc-port 60001 --resources-path ../dapr/components mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

1. Open a **new** terminal window and change the current folder to `TrafficControlService`.

1. Enter the following command to run the TrafficControlService with a Dapr sidecar:

   ```bash
   dapr run --app-id trafficcontrolservice --app-port 6000 --dapr-http-port 3600 --dapr-grpc-port 60000 --resources-path ../dapr/components mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

1. Open a **new** terminal window and change the current folder to `Simulation`.

1. Start the simulation:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

You should see the same logs as before. Obviously, the behavior of the application is exactly the same as before.
