## Next Steps

Well done, you have successfully completed the workshop!

As next steps, you can:

- Explore [Azure Container Apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/). There are many other features that you can use like jobs, private networks, etc. Some of these features are still in preview.
- Look at the [ACA Landing Zone Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/ACA-Landing-Zone-Accelerator) and how to deploy a secure baseline with an internal environment.
  - The application of this workshop is used by the landing zone accelerator to demonstrate the [deployment of microservices in Azure Container Apps](https://github.com/Azure/aca-landing-zone-accelerator/tree/main/scenarios/aca-internal/bicep/sample-apps/java-fine-collection-service). It uses User Managed Identity to access Azure resources: Service Bus, Cosmos DB and Key Vault.
  - The sample app images used are based on the [end-to-end flow branch](https://github.com/Azure/java-aks-aca-dapr-workshop/tree/e2e-flow) that can be used to check your solutions for the workshop.
- Contribute to this workshop by adding new challenges or improving the existing ones.
