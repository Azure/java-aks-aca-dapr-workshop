# Assignment 3 - Using Dapr for pub/sub with other brokers

With Dapr you can easily without code changes switch between different [pub/sub brokers](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub/). In this assignment you will learn how to use Dapr with RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus and Azure Cache for Redis.

All the assignments of this module can be done independently from each other. You can choose to do one or all of them. It is recommended to do Azure Service Bus assignment as it will help with the challenge at the end of the workshop.
